# Small-term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency-model

#### The tf-idf model is a statistical model which uses the occurrence and importance of a word within a corpus/document. This model is used for document retrieval, text mining, user modelling, and search engines.

#### The model which I have built here uses a simplified  version of a tf-idf model using the term frequency and statistical score of a word within a selection of texts documents.

#### this simple model can help sort unlabeled documents, or even be expanded to aid in classification of documents for automated retrieval or feeds within data pipelines to other models
